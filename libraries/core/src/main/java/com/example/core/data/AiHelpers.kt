            "6 cups cornflakes (use gluten free, if needed)\n" +
            "1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese\n" +
            "1 teaspoon smoked paprika\n" +
            "1/2 teaspoon onion powder\n" +

            "1/2 cup honey\n" +
            "2-3 tablespoons hot sauce\n" +
            "1-3 teaspoons cayenne pepper\n" +

            "Instructions\n" +
            "1. Preheat the oven to 425Â° F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\n" +
            "2. In a food processor, combine the cornflakes, parmesan, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, and a pinch of salt. Pulse until you have fine crumbs. Alternatively, you can crush the crumbs in a ziplock bag by stepping on them. Dump the crumbs into a shallow bowl.\n" +
            "3. Beat the eggs in a bowl, add the hot sauce and chicken, and toss well to coat.\n" +
            "3. Dredge the chicken through the crumbs, covering fully. Place on the prepared baking sheet. For a thicker coating, dip the chicken back through the eggs, then through the crumbs a 2nd time. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until crisp all around.\n" +
            "4. Just before the chicken is done cooking, make the sauce. In a sauce pot, warm together the honey, hot sauce, cayenne, chili powder, onion powder, and garlic powder, plus a pinch of salt.\n" +
            "5. Drizzle the warm sauce over the chicken. Top with herbs. If the sauce thickens, warm for 5 seconds in the microwave. Enjoy!\n" +
